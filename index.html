            <p id="aboutUtah">As I said, I live in Utah. Utah is known for being the capitol of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Utah is also known for it's ecosystem diversities. We have deserts with sand dunes, mountains filled with pinetrees and snow, and the classic "red rock" of southern Utah. In northeastern Utah, there is the Dinosaur Museum and The Quarry Exhibit Hall that houses a wall with roughly 1,500 dinosaur bones. </p>
